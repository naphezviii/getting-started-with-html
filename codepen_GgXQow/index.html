<h2><p><strong><em>Nanodegree &mdash; Learn to Code</em></strong></p></h2>
<p><strong>Five way of thinking like a programmer:</strong></p>
<p><ol>
  <li>Procedural thinking: creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions (sequential thinking)</li>
  <li>Abstract thinking: finding generality (=> abstractions) to avoid unnecessary repetition</li>
  <li>Systematic debugging: following a structured process to find the mistakes (bugs)</li>
  <li>Technological empathy: being aware that computers are powerful tools and at the same time stupid (no room for ambiguity)</li>
  <li>Systems thinking: breaking a big problem down into smaller components</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Key aspects of the World Wide Web</strong></p>
<p>World Wide Web is a collection of <b>H</b>yper<b>t</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage (HTML) documents that are stored on large computers called <em>servers</em>. These documents have two parts: first the meta data such as title of the pages and other elements like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and then the actual content of the page.<br><br>
To access a document (aka webpage) you have to use a <em>web browser</em> on a computer that sends a <em>HTTP request</em> to a specific server which serves the document back to your terminal.<br><br>
The HTML determines the content (text) and the way it looks (markup). It can reference other content (images and video) as well as links to other HTML pages. These are <em>HTML attributes</em>.<br><br>
A HTML page consists of <em>elements</em>. They are the building blocks: content bracketed with so called <em>tags</em>. It is not necessary to know all the tags. A good resource can be found <a href ="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">here</a>.
<br>
<br> </p>
<p><strong>Span and div</strong></p>
<p>It is important to note that some <em>elements</em> are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. This means they either flow with the text or have a hight and width that can be assigned around the content.</p>
